Hi, My name is Pankaj. I am a passionate atmospheric scientist and a machine learning enthusiast; currently pursuing my PhD as a member of ATMOS research group at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur under the supervision of [Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath](http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=SWmUS). My research interests include bayesian statistics, explainable artificial intelligence, causal network analysis, deep learning and atmospheric chemistry models. I study the interactions of chemistry and weather/climate using a suite of statistical and physical models, and develop open source tools for modeling and analysis.

I graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 2017 with a masters degree in Earth system science and Technology where I worked on the problem of stratospheric ozone hole in Antarctica. Before moving to the field of Atmospheric chemistry and physics, I had a brief stint at a reputed metal fabrication and processing company in India. I have a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology (BIT).
