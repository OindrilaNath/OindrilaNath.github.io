Being an atmospheric scientist, I study weather/climate and chemistry interactions using Bayesian statistics and explainable machine learning, and develop open source tools for atmospheric modeling and analysis. 

1. Compared long term total column ozone datasets from various ground based instruments with satellite based observations in Antarctic region.
2. Estimated rainfall using preliminary data from Doppler Weather radar in Kolkata region using wradlib radar data analysis package in python.
3. Investigated freezing of water droplet and subsequent transformation of its shape numerically using MATLAB.
