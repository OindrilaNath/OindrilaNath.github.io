# Emergence of ozone recovery evidenced by reduction in the occurrence of Antarctic ozone loss saturation ([journal article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0052-6))

![Proportion of ozone loss saturation evidenced from satellite and ozonesonde measurements.](/images/sonde11.png){width=90%}

This study reveals clear observational indications that the Antarctic ozone inside the loss saturation altitudes is increasing and recovering, although the saturation of ozone loss is expected to continue to occur in very cold winters due to the still high levels of ozone depleting substances (ODS) in the stratosphere, as the reduction processes of atmospheric burden of halogens are comparatively slow. The disappearance of near-zero ozone concentrations between 12 and 21 km is a key milestone in the recovery of Antarctic ozone and it would also mark the return of ozone to 1980 levels, as 1987 is the start year of occurrence of loss saturation.
