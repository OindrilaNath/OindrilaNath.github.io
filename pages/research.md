<h3 class="card-title" align="left">Emergence of ozone recovery evidenced by reduction in the occurrence of Antarctic ozone loss saturation</h3>
<p class="card-text" align='justify'>A number of studies have already reported the early signs of the healing of ozone hole (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6296/269.full">Solomon et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00722-7">Kuttippurath et al., 2017</a>). However, there has not been any study reporting the healing in saturation layers. Ozone hole saturation layers are the atmospheric layers in the lower stratosphere (13-21 km from the sea level) where the complete destruction of ozone occurs. In this study, we have reported the comprehensive analysis of vertical, spatial and temporal evolution of ozone loss saturation within the Antarctic polar vortex using high resolution measurements during 1979-2017. Our analysis reveals that the loss saturation started in 1987 and have occurred in all winters thereafter, except a few winters of 1988 and 2002 when major stratospheric warmings occurred. We show a clear reduction in the occurrence of ozone loss saturation during 2001-2017; consistent throughout various datasets (ozonesonde and satellite observations of ozone profiles and total column ozone). </p>

<h3 class="card-title" align="left"><br/>Arctic on the verge of an ozone hole? <br/></h3>
<p class="card-text" align='justify'>  Severe vortex-wide ozone loss in the Arctic would expose nearly 650 million people and ecosystem to unhealthy ultra-violet radiation levels. Adding to these worries, clear signature of an ozone hole (ozone column values below 220 DU) appeared over the Arctic in March and April 2020. Sporadic occurrences of ozone hole values at different regions of vortex for almost three weeks were found for the first time in the observed history in the Arctic. Furthermore, a record-breaking ozone loss of about 2.0–3.4 ppmv triggered by an unprecedented chlorine activation (1.5–2.2 ppbv) matching to the levels of Antarctic ozone hole conditions was also observed. The polar processing situation led to the first-ever appearance of loss saturation in the Arctic. Apart from these, there were also ozone-mini holes in December 2019 and January 2020 driven by atmospheric dynamics. Our study suggests that the very colder Arctic winters in near future would also very likely to experience even more ozone loss and encounter ozone hole situations, provided the stratospheric chlorine levels still stay high there. </p>
