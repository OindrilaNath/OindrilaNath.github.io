**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

**Research Scholar, ATMOS Lab, PhD 2017 -- Present**

-   Setup WRF-Chem and GEOS-Chem for atmospheric composition studies.

-   Merged and bias-corrected long term data record of vertical profiles
    of rainfall, ozone and related trace gases using various correction
    techniques like quantile mapping and scaled distribution mapping.

-   Assessed and bias-corrected long term total column ozone datasets
    from various ground based instruments in Arctic region.

-   Analysed Polar vortex based stratospheric ozone for detection of
    ozone hole saturation using ground-based and satellite based
    measurements in Antarctic region.

-   Developed Receptor models based on airmass trajectory generated with
    HYSPLIT in python for source detection studies and clustered them
    using Hierarchical agglomerative clustering and wavelet transform
    based Mean-shift clustering for transportation pathways analysis.

-   Investigated Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change over North-East India
    using Google Earth Engine and Random forest based classification.
