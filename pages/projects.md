These are all projects under development, and will be made open shortly.

**Open source projects**

- [markdown-scholar](https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar): A python tool to convert tables from pandas to latex or markdown format.

- [Artifical-Intelligence-Projects](https://github.com/pankajkarman/Artifical-Intelligence-Projects): A collection of projects implementing various machine learning methods from scratch in python. It also contains a project implementing a Question answering model using Dynamic memory network (DMN) based on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) dataset.

- HyTraj: It is a python library, still under development, for performing receptor modeling using trajectories generated with HYSPLIT model. It'll have functions for generating large number of air-parcel trajectories with parallel processing; reducing the trajectories generation time. It will also have appropriate tools for clustering trajectories using different clustering techniques. 

- land-use-land-cover-classification: A collection of python scripts to perform LULC analysis using satellite remote sensing data and Google Earth Engine platform using random forest and SVM classifiers. These scripts include functions for data preprocessing i.e. False color composite (FCC) creation, Digital Number (DN) conversion to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance, Atmospheric correction using Dark object subtraction, cloud correction using timeseries data, color balancing, mosaicing and clipping of rasters using shapefiles, rasterisation of training shapefiles etc. Since a journal paper is under preparation based on the methods implemented in this repository, repository will be made public after the puplication of paper.

- [Autoencoder based clustering using self organising maps (AuSOM)](https://github.com/pankajkarman/AuSOM): It is a python library to perform SOM based clustering of trajectories using sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. It is still under development, and will be open shortly. 

- [CausalDiscovery](https://github.com/pankajkarman/CausalDiscovery): A python library for performing causal network analysis using Transformer based architecture. It is still under development. Please have a look at this [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/1/1/19) for an idea about the aim of this library.
