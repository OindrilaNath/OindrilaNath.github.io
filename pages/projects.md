These are all projects under development, and will be made open shortly.

**Open source projects**

- [markdown-scholar](https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar): A python tool to convert tables from pandas to latex or markdown format.

- [Autoencoder based clustering using self organising maps (AuSOM)](https://github.com/pankajkarman/AuSOM): It is a python library to perform SOM based clustering of trajectories using sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. It is still under development, and will be open shortly.

- HyTraj: It is a python library, still under development, for performing receptor modeling using trajectories generated with HYSPLIT model. It'll have functions for generating large number of air-parcel trajectories with parallel processing; reducing the trajectories generation time. It will also have appropriate tools for clustering trajectories using different clustering techniques.  

- [CausalDiscovery](https://github.com/pankajkarman/CausalDiscovery): A python library for performing causal network analysis using Transformer based architecture. It is still under development. Please have a look at this [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/1/1/19) for an idea about the aim of this library.
