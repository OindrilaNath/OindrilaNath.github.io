**Open source projects**

- [markdown-scholar](https://github.com/pankajkarman/markdown-scholar): A python tool to convert a table from pandas to latex or markdown formats.

- [Autoencoder based clustering using self organising maps (AuSom)](https://github.com/pankajkarman/AuSOM): It is python library to perform SOM based clustering of trajectories using sequence-to-sequence autoencer. It is still under development and will be open shortly.

- HyTraj: It is a python library still under development for performing receptor modeling using trajectories generated with HYSPLIT model. It'll have functions for generating large nuber of trajectories with parallel processing reducing the trajectories generation time. It will also have support for clustering trajectories using different clustering techniques.  

- [CausalDiscovery](https://github.com/pankajkarman/CausalDiscovery): A python library for performing causal network analysis using Transformer architecture. It is still under development.
